In the context of my PhD, I'm using and programming in [Quantum Package](https://github.com/QuantumPackage/qp2),
a Fortran programming environnement for wave function methods. You can
find its documentation [here](https://quantum-package.readthedocs.io/en/master/).

Inside there are a significant amount of programs:
- SCF (RHF/ROHF)
- CIS
- CISD
- CIPSI (Configuration Interaction using a Perturbative Selection made Iteratively)
- CCSD (RHF/ROHF)
- CCSD(T) (RHF/ROHF)
- Transcorrelated methods
- Orbital localization (Foster-Boys/Pipek-Mezey)
- Orbital optimization for CI wave functions
- ...

Don't hesitate to send me a message if you have any question about it.
