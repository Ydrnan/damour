Hello! 

I'm Yann Damour, a third year PhD student under the supervision of 
[Pierre-François Loos](https://pfloos.github.io/WEB_LOOS/) and 
[Anthony Scemama](https://scemama.github.io/) at the [LCPQ](https://www.lcpq.ups-tlse.fr/) 
in Toulouse (France). My research primarily focuses on the development and the
implementation of methods for both ground and excited states in quantum chemistry,
using Configuration-Interaction and Coupled-Cluster formalisms.

In my free time, I'm writing my own quantum chemistry code in Rust (a
beautiful and user-friendly language compared to Fortran) and practicing 
archery.

Upon completion of my PhD, I would like to move to the United States for a postdoctoral
position in the field of method development in quantum chemistry.
