I'm currently writing a quantum chemistry code in Rust on my free time. For the moment it has working RHF, ROHF, RHF/MP2, ROHF/MP2. The implementation of RHF and ROHF/CCSD is in progress...
As soon as the interface with [Quantum Package](https://github.com/QuantumPackage/qp2) will be finished (and clean) I will push it on a Github repository.

Stay tuned !
